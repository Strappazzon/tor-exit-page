				This router is part of the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Anonymity Network</a>, which is dedicated to
				<a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/about/overview">providing privacy</a> to people who need it most: average users. This router IP should
				be generating no other traffic, unless it has been compromised.
			</p>

			<p>
				Tor works by running user traffic through a random chain of encrypted servers, and then letting the traffic exit the Tor network through an exit
				node like this one. This design makes it very hard for a service to know which user is connecting to it, since it can only see the IP-address of
				the Tor exit node:

				{% include tor-overview.svg %}
			</p>

				<a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/about/overview">Read more about how Tor works.</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				Tor sees use by <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/about/torusers">many important segments of the population</a>, including whistle
				blowers, journalists, Chinese dissidents skirting the Great Firewall and oppressive censorship, abuse victims, stalker targets, the US military,
				and law enforcement, just to name a few. While Tor is not designed for malicious users, it is true that they can use the network for malicious
				ends. In reality however, the actual amount of <a href="https://support.torproject.org/abuse/">abuse</a> is quite low. This is largely because
				criminals and hackers have significantly better access to privacy and anonymity than do the regular users whom they prey upon. Criminals can
				and do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220717052318/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/08/web_fraud_20_tools.html">build,
				sell, and trade</a> far larger and
				<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220717052320/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/08/web_fraud_20_distributing_your.html">
				more powerful networks</a> than Tor on a daily basis. Thus, in the mind of this operator, the social need for easily accessible
				censorship-resistant private, anonymous communication trumps the risk of unskilled bad actors, who are almost always more easily uncovered by
				traditional police work than by extensive monitoring and surveillance anyway.
			</p>

			<p>
				In terms of applicable law, the best way to understand Tor is to consider it a network of routers operating as common carriers, much like the
				Internet backbone. However, unlike the Internet backbone routers, Tor routers explicitly do not contain identifiable routing information about
				the source of a packet, and no single Tor node can determine both the origin and destination of a given transmission.
			</p>

			<p>
				As such, there is little the operator of this router can do to help you track the connection further. This router maintains no logs of any of
				the Tor traffic, so there is little that can be done to trace either legitimate or illegitimate traffic (or to filter one from the other).
				Attempts to seize this router will accomplish nothing.

					Furthermore, this machine also serves as a carrier of email, which means that its contents are further protected under the ECPA.
					<a href="https://law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2707">18 USC 2707</a> explicitly allows for civil remedies ($1000/account plus legal fees)
					in the event of a seizure executed without good faith or probable cause (it should be clear at this point that traffic originating from
					{% if site.ips.size >= 2 %}these IP addresses{% else %}this IP address{% endif %} should not constitute probable cause to seize the machine).
					Similar considerations exist for 1st amendment content on this machine.

				<p>
					If you are a representative of a company who feels that this router is being used to violate the DMCA, please be aware that this machine
					does not host or contain any illegal content. Also be aware that network infrastructure maintainers are not liable for the type of content
					that passes over their equipment, in accordance with <a href="https://law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512">DMCA "safe harbor" provisions</a>.
					In other words, you will have just as much luck sending a takedown notice to the Internet backbone providers. Please consult
					<a href="https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/eff-tor-legal-faq/tor-dmca-response/">EFF's prepared response</a> for

				That being said, if you still have a complaint about the router, you may contact <span>{{ site.name }}</span>, the operator of this exit router,
				at <span>{{ site.email }}</span>{% if site.pgp != null %} (<a href="{{ site.pgp }}">PGP Key</a>){% endif %}. If complaints are related to a
				particular service that is being abused, I will consider removing that service from my exit policy, which would prevent my router from allowing
				that traffic to exit through it. I can only do this on an IP+destination port basis, however.
				{% if site.p2p == true %}Common P2P ports are already blocked.{% endif %}
			</p>

			<p>
				You also have the option of blocking this IP address and others on the Tor network if you so desire. The Tor project provides a
				<a href="https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist">web service</a> to fetch a list of all IP addresses of Tor exit nodes that allow exiting
				to a specified IP:port combination, and an official <a href="https://dist.torproject.org/tordnsel/">DNSRBL</a> is also available to determine if
				a given IP address is actually a Tor exit server. Please be considerate when using these options. It would be unfortunate to deny all Tor users
				access to your site indefinitely simply because of a few bad apples.
