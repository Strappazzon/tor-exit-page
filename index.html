		<h1>{{ site.title }}</h1>
		<p>
			Most likely you are accessing this website because you had some issue with the traffic coming from this IP
			address{% if site.ip != null %} (<span>{{ site.ip }}</span>){% endif %}. This router is part of the
			<a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor Anonymity Network</a>, which is dedicated to providing privacy to people who wants to
			use the internet anonymously. This router should be generating no other traffic, unless it has been compromised.
		</p>
		<p>
			As can be seen from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview#thesolution">Tor overview page</a>, the Tor network
			is designed to make tracing of users impossible. This is because the Tor network is a censorship-resistant, privacy, and
			anonymity system used by <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers">many important segments of the population</a>,
			including whistle blowers, journalists, Chinese dissidents skirting the Great Firewall and oppressive censorship, abuse
			victims, stalker targets, the US military, and law enforcement, just to name a few. While Tor is not designed for malicious
			computer users, it is true that they can use the network for malicious ends. In reality however, the actual amount of
			<a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq-abuse">abuse</a> is quite low. This is largely because criminals and hackers
			have significantly better access to privacy and anonymity than do the regular users whom they prey upon. Criminals can and do
			<a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/08/web_fraud_20_tools.html">build, sell, and trade</a> far larger and
			<a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/08/web_fraud_20_distributing_your.html">more powerful networks</a> than
			Tor on a daily basis. Thus, in the mind of this operator, the social need for easily accessible censorship-resistant private,
			anonymous communication trumps the risk of unskilled bad actors, who are almost always more easily uncovered by traditional police
			work than by extensive monitoring and surveillance anyway.
		</p>
		<p>
			In terms of applicable law, the best way to understand Tor is to consider it a network of routers operating as common
			carriers, much like the Internet backbone. However, unlike the Internet backbone routers, Tor routers explicitly do not
			contain identifiable routing information about the source of a packet, and no single Tor node can determine both the origin
			and destination of a given transmission.
		</p>
		<p>
			As such, there is little the operator of this router can do to help you track the connection further. This router maintains
			no logs of any of the Tor traffic, so there is little that can be done to trace either legitimate or illegitimate traffic
			(or to filter one from the other). Attempts to seize this router will accomplish nothing.
		</p>
		{% if site.sections.dmca == true %}
		<p>
			If you are a representative of a company who feels that this router is being used to violate the DMCA, please be aware that this
			machine does not host or contain any illegal content. Also be aware that network infrastructure maintainers are not liable for the
			type of content that passes over their equipment, in accordance with <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512">DMCA
			"safe harbor" provisions</a>. In other words, you will have just as much luck sending a takedown notice to the Internet backbone
			providers. Please consult <a href="https://www.torproject.org/eff/tor-dmca-response">EFF's prepared response</a> for more information
			on this matter.

		<p>
			If you still have a complaint about the router, you may contact <span>{{ site.name }}</span>, who runs this exit router, at
			<span>{{ site.email }}</span>{% if site.pgp != null %} (<a href="{{ site.pgp }}">PGP Key</a>){% endif %}. If complaints are related to a
			particular service that is being abused, I will consider removing that service from my exit policy, which would prevent my router
			from allowing that traffic to exit through it. However, I can only do this on an IP + destination port basis. Common P2P ports are
			already blocked.
		</p>
		<p>
			You also have the option of blocking this IP address and others on the Tor network if you so desire. The Tor project provides a
			<a href="https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py">web service</a> to fetch a list of all IP addresses of Tor exit
			nodes that allow exiting to a specified IP:port combination, and an official
			<a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/tordnsel">DNSRBL</a> is also available to determine if a given IP address is actually
			a Tor exit server. Please be considerate when using these options. It would be unfortunate to deny all Tor users access to your
			website indefinitely simply because of a few bad apples.
