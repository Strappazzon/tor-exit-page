## About

This is an alternative design to the [default "This is a Tor Exit Router" page](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/raw/HEAD/contrib/operator-tools/tor-exit-notice.html) provided by The Tor Project.

This notice is intended to be placed on a virtual host for a domain that your Tor exit router IP reverse resolves to, so that people who may be about to file an abuse complaint would check it first before bothering you or your ISP.

## Getting Started

### Configuration

You must configure the notice page before you start using it.  
To do so, open **_config.yml** with a source code editor and start adjusting the variables to your needs.
